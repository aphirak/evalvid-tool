# evalvid-tool
Docker file for building evalvid toolset 
----
This is the repository for compiling Evalvid toolset source code. It uses the Docker environment, which is easy to deploy.
Although the original evalvid source code cannot download from the official website (https://www.tkn.tu-berlin.de/research/evalvid/), there are currently three available links on the github: https://github.com/soohyunc/evalvid-2.7, https://github.com/lsiddd/evalvid, and https://github.com/janieltec/Evalvid-2.7. I choose the source code from https://github.com/soohyunc/evalvid-2.7 and do some modification and compilation as suggested on this website https://janieltec.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/how-install-the-evalvid-2-7/.
